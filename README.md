# stringProject

In this string project I developed a string ADT class that uses operator overloading and dynamically allocated arrays. 
The string construct is a NULL terminating character array.

Running and testing:
"make tests" will build and run tests
"make oracle" will run the oracle tests to check each constructor and operator, however they only work on wasp/hornet
"make logview" will build and run logview.cpp. The program will either print all logentry entries, print total number of bytes of all logs, or print the host for each logentry. To run the program use "./logview all log_1_tiny.txt
